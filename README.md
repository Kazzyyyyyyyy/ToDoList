This is my first real coding project.
I had prior experience, but very little; knew what int, string, char, for, while and foreach loops are.
Thats pretty much it.
I also coded some Minecraft Plugins before, but when I was 13 or something and I basically just copy-pasted everything, so I don't know if that counts.

---------------------------------------------------

This started as a simple Console app where you could save and load some stuff in a txt file.
After about 3 days with that, I started learning basic WPF and how to implement my code in it.

After the ToDo app was functional with TXT, I wanted something more challenging and so I learned SQLite and later made the whole app working with it.
It took me about 4 weeks of coding 4-6h a day, from knowing little to nothing to finishing this program.

As always, I used as little help as possible and I tried to do most things myself.
The only thing I literally just copy-pasted was the MainWindow GUI and the App.xaml dark mode stuff, because I wasnt really super interested in learning so much WPF while I couldnt even code in basic C#.

---------------------------------------------------

I learned all of the C#/WPF and SQLite basics while working on this.
Even though the codebase is nothing you want to work on in any case, Im still pretty proud of it considering its my first real C# project.
